It's 2016 and our Progress towards immortality is rather Dissapointing. The only good news is that more and more people realise the posibility and want to help. However we still don't even know how the aging process works and
anti-aging research isn't funded enough. Every longenity medicine or technique we have either does very poorly or doesnt work at all. If things were to continue at this pace we wouldn't make any progress for decades. But dont despair! There is a glimmer of hope shiding down upon us, Quantum Computers.    </p>


    <p class = "title">The Quantum age</p>

     <p class="blog">
  Biology research is closely connected with information technologies and one big reason we arent making any progress in the field of medicine is because our computers are weak. </p>
<p class="blog">
  Quantum computers which are slowly making their debut will be able to solve in a matter of minutes biological problems that our super-computers would take days.
  As of now Quantum computers are under development, and although prototypes exist it will take a while before every big company has one.
   Google already owns a Quantum Computer developed by canadian company D-Wave, claiming it to be millions of times faster
  than it's binnary counterpart.</p>

  After Quantum Computers start getting used in biology research i personally expect huge medicine breakthoughs to be on the news every other day.
  So our anti-aging stuff won't take long.
