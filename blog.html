    <p class = "title">Life Expectancy and the Limit</p>
    <p class="blog">

      I guess it's time for my first blog post.
      For this first post i'd like to talk a bit about life expectancy whitch is the average number of years a person lives.
      Global life expectancy has been going up, thanks to better medicine, technologies and quality of life.
      The toping countries right now are Japan with 83.7 years and Switzerland with 83.4 years of age respectively.
      But hold on, in Japan life expectancy in 2000 was 81,1 years. That's only about 2 years more and we are much more advanced than
      16 years ago. These results are rather disappointing but are part of a wider truth.
    </p>
    <p class="blog">
        Humans no matter how optimal they eat and live can't get past 120 years of age, considering one doesn't succumb to diseases,
        and health defects.
      But optimal living is almost impossible and even if it was possible many people would rather not follow such strict rules.
      But living well enough is hard. We live in a global economical crisis, some live in poor conditions, sometimes (everyday for some) we have to resort to fast food,
      we get stressed at our jobs and well you get the point. So don't feel guilt about mistreating your body.
    </p>
    <p class="blog">
      The path to living a century contains longevity technioques which aim to delay the ("H-L" aging process ) by reducing damage mainly caused from bad
      nutrition and stress. By doing so the person has a better aging. Less pains, less diseases etc. For example you are a 60 year old with a 50 year old's body.
      Still attenpiting to make things right at some point doesnt make up for the damage one's body has sustained before.
    </p>

    <p class ="blog">
      To close my first blog post with some hope, the real sollution to the problem will soon be within our grasp and by soon i mean no later than 20 years.
      After all it's what everyone wishes for.
