Life extension technologies will make our lives amazing. Noone wants to be and look old or to have a barrier to their maximun lifespan. Noone wants to lose people important to them because of aging.
We wont be bound by the expectations of what someone should do in thier age,
we will have time to do anything we want, from seeing the whole world to reading that few books we always wanted to read. Maybe our grandchildren will get angry about how they can never beat us in video games.

It will be a world where you can't tell someone's age by their looks as everyone will be young. Retirement will stop and the
retired that went through rejunivation will have to work again.  A world where the older arent considered outdated and weak but wise and experienced.</p>

  <p class="title">  Longer age... a benefit than a curse</p>
  <p class ="blog">
    Let's face it aging is a curse
    Humans will be like whiskey, better with every year of age. When you take out the negative effect aging has on your body all that remains is the wisdom and experience you have attained.
    No longer will your age be a barrier to your hobbies, your job or your relationships with people.

So i was playing a multiplayer game and a guy. The older are the worse it gets
In a world where humans dont age hopefully your favourite band can play on forever but on the other hand a criminal sentenced for 70 years that wouldn't make it out of jail can now make it.
So a question  rises about who is eligible for immortality. Is there going to be a filter about who has a right to rejunivation and who doesn't?

In such a world you might be able to play sports with your grandfather
What would happen in  a world where the people with power as politicians, billionares and dictators are around forever ?
are around forever ?

Families would change too. The older generations are still around, so a classic family's members in the future might easily reach 50 members.
Ofcourse in the early years biological immortality is propably the way to go. Not everyone can afford a supercomputer to upload his mind and to shrink a


Can you imagine being the same age as your father, maybe even playing computer games with your grandfather ?

Parts of society
like pensioninst might have to leave if the pensionist now has a young body and can and propably wants to work again.

Difference in wisdom. Let's asume a young member of society at thier middle 20's that just finished the latest most modern studies in computer science.


A new member of society might come upon a wisdom wall upon trying to stand on their own. in a world when a person in his mid twenties that just finished their studies
will have to rival humans that have been around for abount a century and have vastly more experience.
The young person will be outclassed in everything, from cooking skills to social skills and so on. Youth, witch in our society is considered the height of a person's life,
where we can perform our best before we fall of in the future might be more of a curse than a blessing. Of course society should make sure that newer members are
added aproprietly.
