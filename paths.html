    <p class="title"> Paths to immortality </p>
    <p class ="blog"> There's two ways so far to achieve immortality. Either attaining an unaging body or becoming a macchine. Both having their own advantages and dissadvantages.
    <p class = "title">Biological Immortality</p>
    <p class="blog">Life extension technologies like anti-aging medicine, artificial cells and organs, gene therapy and even the fantasy cell repairing nanobots, are some of the highly anticipated
      scientific breakthroughs that will increase human life expectancy stop or even reverse the <a href="wwa.html">aging process </a> and lead to complete biological immortality.
    </p>
    <p class="blog">
      Anti-aging medicine that works is expected to hit the markets by 2020 and in some countries enthusiasts have created political parties in order to provide political help to researchers.
      Biological immortality isn't science fiction, sooner or later it will be here.
    </p>
    <p class = "title">Mind Uploading</p>

     <p class="blog">
    In the future hardware is expected to become so potent that it can emulate a human mind. Humans will have the choice of uploading their consiousness
    to a super-computer by perfectly mapping and emulating the aproximatelly 100 billion neurons that the human brain has.
  </p>
  <p class="blog">
 To get even close to this technology humanity
 will have to first master artificial inteligence, creating a human brain emulator is impossible for humans even if all our programmers worked together so an artificial super-inteligence
 will have to do it for us. Of course some other
 problems along the way would include the huge cost and ethical issues that might prohibit this technology from even existing. Overall i would consider this route to
 immortality 40+ years away although i could be proven wrong.
