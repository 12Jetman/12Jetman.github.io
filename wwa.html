      <p class = "title">The Aging Process</p>
      <p class="blog">
      While the complete process of aging is still unclear the main reason we age can be attributed to the gene damage our cells take when they divide.
      </p>
      <p class="blog">
        As you should know, new human cells are created though cell division (mitosis) where a parent cell splits in two or more daughter cells.
        The problem is that when a human cell divides it's telomeres are shortened.
        Telomeres act as the barriers that protect chromosomes (which contain our DNA) from fusing with other chromosomes or mutating.
        When the cell has divided a lot of times and the cell's telomeres are too short it will stop dividing.

        <p class="blog">
        As a human grows older more and more cells reach their limit (called Hayflick limit) and stop dividing, with less active cells the organism begins to fall off
        until the damage is too great to survive. A normal human cell can divide about 60 times before the telomeres are too short and it's sad that when we are born our telomeres are already shortened
          since we had to grow from a single cell to a human and that takes a lot of cell divisions.
      </p>
      <p class = "title">Searching a Solution</p>
      <p class="blog">
          Alright so all we have to do is to stop the telomere shortening right ?
          And what if i told you that already happens ?
          That's right humans can produce an enzyme named Telomerase that repairs damages telomeres.
          Telomerase is mostly found in stem cells and cancer cells while normal cells have tiny amounts.
          Yes you guessed right, cancer tumors are immortal, most tumors would grow indefinitely given that the enviroment is apropriate.
          Who knows, maybe the greatest disease that plagues humanity also holds the answer to eternal youth.
      </p>

      <p class = "title">The real reason we age</p>
      <p class="blog">
      Our cells can already produce telomerase so why are they doing it? Well aging which is considered a disease by many
      immortality enthousiasts is actually a mechanism for evolution, without which there propably wouldnt be any humans.
      The old ones have to give the lead to the new, smarter, stronger more evolved. If the older unevolved are still alive and can
      reproduce then all evolution momentum is lost.</p>
